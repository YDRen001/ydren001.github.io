<h2>Project Overview </h2>
<h2>Project Plan </h2>
<ul><li><p><b> Polarization-aligned Cross-soil Communication </b></p></li></ul>
We focus on designing a reliable cross-soil communication system that is compatible with COTS LoRa
radios. Inspired by the root-cause analysis in our upper-ground weak signal decoding system, we have conducted extensive empirical studies to find out the root cause of SNR 
degradation in cross-soil communication. The key observation is that in cross-soil communication, signal scattering, reflection, and refraction are inevitable during signal
propagation in soils, making the polarization variation at the receiving antenna. The polarization misalignment significantly degrades communication reliability. We propose to keep polarization
aligned under two tasks automatically. First, we propose to design a hardware component to make the polarization configurable. Second, we propose to design a scheduler to trigger a calibration process for optimizing
communication reliability and extra energy overhead simultaneously
